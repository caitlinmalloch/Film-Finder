Codecademy Project using API key and async JS

This project is part of the Codecademy Full-Stack Engineer Program. 
API key is kept private in this project. You can generate your own API Key to use here: https://www.themoviedb.org/signup. 
Make an account and request your own personal API key to be used in the code. 

I will be hosting this site live in the future.
